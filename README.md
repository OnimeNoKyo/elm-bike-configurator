# Elm Bike Configurator

Pretty simple app for configuring a bike with colored components, written in Elm.
This is my public playground for exploring Elm and trying to grow this app by learning more about the programming language.

I'll try to make the commits as meaningful as possible, so you can follow along.

Here is the [demo](https://dennisreimann.github.io/elm-bike-configurator/).

## Setup

    $ npm install
    $ elm-package install

## Building and running the app

    $ npm start

This builds the app with webpack and gives you a live-reloading server on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## Used tools

* [elm-webpack-loader](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-webpack-loader)
* [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format)
